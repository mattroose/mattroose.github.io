<h3>I recently got this Pentax k1000 camera from my grandfather but I broke it almost immediately. Working on repairing it now. Once I get it going I'll hopefully have some new cooler photos to share.</h3>

<h3>i thought it might be fun to try and code my own website. if you made it this far, text me that you're reading this so I can try and keep a guestbook of everyone that has visited. Maybe one day I'll even figure out how to code comments!<h3>
