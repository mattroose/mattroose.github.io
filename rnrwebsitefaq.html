<h3>Q: whose head has replaced my cursor?</h3>
<h4>A: kyle!</a>


<h3>Q: did you make it look this crappy on purpose?</h3>
<h4>A: Yes. Please see <a href = "https://www.sdarchive.com">sdarchive.com</a>
<h4> <a href = "https://www.boblinks.com">boblinks.com</a> and <a href = "https://www.expectingrain.com">expectingrain.com</a> were also key points of reference for how I wanted the website to look. As I get better at coding i will continue to build towards something like this, with more bells and whistles</h4>



<h3>Q: how did you make this?</h3>
<h4>A: html and css with a little help from chatgpt to get things off the ground. i think the code behind this website would make an actual developer cry but it's good enough for me</a>
